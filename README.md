# Spotitube

A Spotify looks like YouTube! While there are numerous repositories for Spotify clones or YouTube clones, I noticed the absence of a repository combining the design of YouTube with the content of Spotify, which I found intriguing. As a result, I decided to create this project to fill that gap.

Feel free to explore this unique web application that brings together the best of both worlds: the visual appeal of YouTube and the music streaming experience of Spotify. It offers a fresh and exciting way to discover and enjoy music.
